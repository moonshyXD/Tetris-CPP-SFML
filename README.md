This program is a Tetris game. In this game, there is a player's score counter, a game restart button, and the main game code. 
For this game to work correctly, you need to connect and configure the SFML library in your project.
The game functions thanks to the methods of the Tetris class, the Button is necessary for the correct operation of the restart button, and the AssetManager was used for the proper functioning of the restart button.
